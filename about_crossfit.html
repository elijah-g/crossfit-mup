<h1>
What is CrossFit?
</h1>


<!--Text from: https://www.crossfit.com/what-is-crossfit-->
<p class="light-gray">
    CrossFit is a fitness regimen developed by Greg Glassman over several decades. Glassman, CrossFit's Founder and CEO,
    was the first person in history to define fitness in a meaningful, measurable way: increased work capacity across
    broad time and modal domains. He then created a program specifically designed to improve fitness and health.
    CrossFit is constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity. All CrossFit workouts are based on
    functional movements, and these movements reflect the best aspects of gymnastics, weightlifting, running, rowing and
    more. These are the core movements of life. They move the largest loads the longest distances, so they are ideal for
    maximizing the amount of work done in the shortest time. Intensity is essential for results and is measurable as
    work divided by time—or power. The more work you do in less time, or the higher the power output, the more intense
    the effort. By employing a constantly varied approach to training, functional movements and intensity lead to
    dramatic gains in fitness.

    The community that spontaneously arises when people do these workouts together is a key component of why CrossFit
    is so effective, and it gave birth to a global network of CrossFit affiliates that number over 13,000. Harnessing
    the natural camaraderie, competition and fun of sport or game yields an intensity that cannot be matched by other means.
    The CrossFit program is driven by data. Using whiteboards as scoreboards, keeping accurate scores and records,
    running a clock, and precisely defining the rules and standards for performance, we not only motivate unprecedented
    output but derive both relative and absolute metrics at every workout. This data has important value well beyond motivation.
    Overall, the aim of CrossFit is to forge a broad, general and inclusive fitness supported by measurable, observable
    and repeatable results. The program prepares trainees for any physical contingency—not only for the unknown but for the unknowable, too. Our specialty is not specializing.
