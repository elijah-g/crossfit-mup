<h1>Who are we?</h1>

<p>
    Crossfit Muscle up prides itself in being the <b>best</b> box south of the river. When we say we're the best
    we mean in <b>everything</b>. This means we are a family friendly box that promotes a family type sense of community
    by encouraging everyone to be their best selves. We have the best coaches with the best training and the best facilities.
</p>

<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>
    CrossFit Muscle Up first started in 2017 fulfilling the dream of founder Jayde Chapman. The first box was in a small warehouse
    by the river. The team quickly grew and in March 2018 we upgraded to the current home in the centre of town. Membership
    continues to grow as people gain an appreciation for the philosophies of the box.
</p>

<h3>Our Coaches</h3>
<p>
    All three of our world class coaches have been with us from the beginning. Sarah represented Australia in gymnastics
    as a teenager and has since turned her passion to CrossFit, her loving nature make it easy to take criticism from her.
    Jeff has long been a determined athlete and has developed into an excellent coach yearning to impart his years of wisdom
    to you.
    Coach and founder Steven lives and breaths CrossFit and wants nothing more than for you to be your healthiest and happiest
    self.
